This contains algorithms for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), which, under
certain conditions, can be used to establish a shared secret key between two
communicating parties. This shared secret key can then be used for cryptographic
purposes, like as a shared key for symmetric-key cryptography or as the input to
a key derivation algorithm.
